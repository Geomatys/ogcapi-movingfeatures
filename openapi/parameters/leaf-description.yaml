description: |-
  The `leaf` is provided as a sequence of monotonic increasing instants with date-time strings.
  Only features that have a temporal geometry and property that intersects the given date-time are selected.
  
  The `leaf` operation implements *_pointAtTime_* operation which defined in the OGC Moving Feature Access.
  This operation returns only temporal geometry coordinates (or temporal property values) 
  at each date-time included in the `leaf` parameter, using interpolated trajectory according to the `interpolation` property.
  
  If the `leaf` parameter is provided with a `bbox` or (and) a `datetime` parameter, 
  it will only apply to resources that intersect with a `bbox` or (and) a `datetime` parameter. 

  The `leaf` parameter shall not be used with the `subTrajectory` and `subTemporalValue` parameter. 
  Only one of those parameters can be used in the HTTP GET operation.
