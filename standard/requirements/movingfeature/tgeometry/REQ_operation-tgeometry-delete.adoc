^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/movingfeatures/tgeometry-delete*
^|A |The API implementation SHALL comply with the API-Feature `DELETE` operation requirement link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#_operation_3[`/req/create-replace-delete/delete/delete-op`].
^|B |For every temporal geometry in a moving feature (path `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}`), the server SHALL support the HTTP DELETE operation at the path `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}/tgeometries/{tGeometryId}`
^|C |The path parameter `collectionId` is each `id` property in the `Collection` GET operation response where the value of the `itemType` property is specified as `movingfeature`. +
The path parameter `mFeatureId` is an `id` property of the moving feature. The path parameter `tGeometryId` is an `id` property of the temporal geometry.
