^|A | If the `snapshot` parameter is provided by the client and supported by the server, then only resources that have a temporal geometry (i.e., `datetimes` property) that intersects the temporal information in the `times` parameter SHALL be part of the result set.
^|B | If `snapshot` is true, the endpoint SHALL return only temporal geometry coordinate (or temporal property value) with the snapshot query at each time included in the `times` parameter, using interpolated trajectory according to the `interpolation` property.
^|C | If `snapshot` is true, the `interpolation` property in the response SHALL be 'Discrete'.
