^|B | The `leaf` parameter SHALL match all resources in the moving feature that are associated with temporal information.
^|C | If `leaf` parameter is provided by the client and supported by the server, the endpoint SHALL return only temporal geometry coordinate (or temporal property value) with the *_PointAtTime_* query at each time included in the `leaf` parameter, using interpolated trajectory according to the `interpolation` property.
