=== duration
==== Methods
. Issue a `GET` request on the `{root}/services/SpatiotemporalProcessing/Accessor/duration` path

==== Description

Return a time interval - without gaps - starting with the smallest timestamp till the largest time stamp during which the moving feature was defined.

==== Request parameters

* TemporalGeometry or TemporalProperty: given as literal in the request, as file, or as a query

Example:
`{root}/services/SpatiotemporalProcessing/Accessor/temporal_duration?{root}/collections/{collectionId} /items/{mFeatureId}/tgeometries /{tGeometryId}/{queryType}`

====  Error situations
The requirements for handling unsuccessful requests are provided in <<http-response>>.
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
