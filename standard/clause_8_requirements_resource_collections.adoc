[[resource-collections-section]]
=== Resource Collections
The `Collections` resource supports retrieving and creating operations via GET and POST HTTP methods respectively.

. Retrieving operation returns a set of metadata which describes the collections available from this API. The catalog of collections returned to the response can be limited using the <<limit-section,`limit`>>, <<bbox-section,`bbox`>>, and <<datetime-section,`datetime`>> parameters.
. Creating operation post a new <<resource-collection-section,Collection>> resource instance to the collections with this API.

==== Parameters
The query parameters http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#bbox-parameter-requirements[`bbox`], http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#datetime-parameter-requirements[`datetime`] and http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#limit-parameter-requirements[`limit`] are inherited from API - Common.
All requirements and recommendations in API - Common regarding these parameters also apply for API - Moving Features.

==== Operations
===== Retrieve
This operation is defined in the `https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#rc-collections-section[Collections]` conformance class of API-Common.
No modifications are needed to support `MovingFeature` resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on `{root}/collections` path

Support for HTTP GET method on the `{root}/collections` path is required by API-Common.

====== Create
This operation is defined in the `http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#create[CREATE]` conformance class of API-Features.
This operation targeted <<resource-collection-section,Collection>> resource.

. Issue a `POST` request on `{root}/collections` path

Support for HTTP POST method is required by API-Features.

The following example adds a new feature (collection information) to the feature collections.
The feature is represented as JSON.

==== Response
===== Retrieve
A successful response to the `Collections` GET operation is a document that contains summary metadata for each collection accessible through the API.
In a typical API deployment, the `Collections` GET response will list collections of all offered resource types.
The collections where the value of the `itemType` property is `movingfeature` are collections of moving features.
