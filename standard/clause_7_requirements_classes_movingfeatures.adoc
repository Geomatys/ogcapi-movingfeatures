[[resource-mfeatures-section]]
=== Resource MovingFeatures
The `MovingFeatures` resource supports retrieving and creating operations via GET and POST HTTP methods respectively.

. Retrieving operation returns a set of features which describes the moving feature available from this API.
. Creating operation post a new <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resource instance to a specific <<resource-collection-section,Collection>> (specified by {collectinoId} with this API.

The MF-API `Items` query is an OGC API-Features endpoint that may be used to catalog pre-existing moving features.
If a `mFeatureID` is not specified, the query will return a list of the available moving features.
The list of moving features returned to the response can be limited using the <<bbox-section,bbox>>, <<datetime-section,datetime>>, and <<limit-section,limit>> parameters.
This behavior is specified in OGC API-Features.
All parameters for use with the `Items` query are defined by OGC API-Features.

==== Operation
===== Retrieve

No modifications are needed to support <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path

Support for GET on the `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path is required by API-Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/tgeometries/REQ_mandatory-temporalgeometry.adoc[]

==== Parameters
[[leaf-section]]
===== Parameter leaf
The `leaf` parameter is a sequence of monotonic increasing instants with date-time strings (ex. "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z") that adheres to RFC3339.
It consists of a list of the date-time format string, different from <<datetime-section, `datetime`>> parameter.
The array does not allow the same element.
//A sequence of monotonic increasing instants only temporal geometries that intersects the value of time is selected.

.Leaf valid (and invalid) Examples
=================
(O) "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"

(O) "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z", "2018-02-12T23:30:50Z"

(O) "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z", "2018-02-12T23:30:50Z", "2018-02-12T23:40:50Z"

(X) "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z", "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"

(X) "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z", "2018-02-12T22:20:50Z"
=================

If `leaf` parameter is provided by the client, the endpoint returns only geometry coordinate (or temporal property value) with the leaf query at each time included in the `leaf` parameter, similar to _**pointAtTime**_ operation in the https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/16-120r3/16-120r3.html#12[OGC Moving Feature Access standard]. And `interpolation` property in the response SHALL be 'Discrete'.
