[[resource-features-section]]
=== Resource Features
The MF-API `Items` query is an OGC API-Features endpoint that may be used to catalog pre-existing moving features.
The `Features` operation returns a set of features which describes the moving feature available from this API.
If a `mFeatureID` is not specified, the query will return a list of the available moving features.
The list of moving features returned to the response can be limited using the <<bbox-section,bbox>>, <<datetime-section,datetime>>, and <<limit-section,limit>> parameters.
This behavior is specified in OGC API-Features.
All parameters for use with the `Items` query are defined by OGC API-Features.

==== Operation
This operation is defined in the `Features` conformance class of API-Features.
No modifications are needed to support <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path

Support for GET on the `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path is required by API-Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/REQ_operation-features.adoc[]

==== Response
A successful response to the `Features` operation is a document that contains the static data of moving features.
In a typical API deployment, the `Features` response will list features of all offered resource types.

[[resource-movingfeature-section]]
=== Resource MovingFeature
==== Overview
A MovingFeature object consists of the set of static information that describes a single moving feature and the set of temporal object information, such as temporal geometry and temporal property.
An abbreviated copy of this information is returned for each `MovingFeature` in the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items` response.

The schema for the moving feature object presented in this clause is an extension of the `GeoJSON Feature Object` defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON].
<<moving-feature-properties-table>> defines the set of properties that may be used to describe a moving feature.

==== Operation
. Issue a `GET` request on the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}` path

[[movingfeature-identifier]]
The {mFeatureId} parameter is the unique identifier for a single moving feature offered by the API.
The list of valid values for `{mFeatureId}` is provided in the <<resource-features-section,`{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items`>> response.

include::requirements/movingfeature/REQ_operation-movingfeature.adoc[]

==== Response
A successful response to the `MovingFeature` operation is a set of metadata that describes the moving feature identified by the <<movingfeature-identifier,`{mFeatureId}`>> parameter.

[[resource-temporalGeometries-section]]
=== Resource TemporalGeometries
The `TGeometries` query returns a set of <<resource-temporalGeometry-section,TemporalGeometry>> which is included in the <<resource-movingfeature-section,`MovingFeature`>> that specified by <<movingfeature-identifier,{mFeatureId}>>.
If a `tGeometryId` is not specified, the query will return a list of the available temporal geometries in the specified moving feature.
The list of temporal geometries returned to the response can be limited using the <<limit-section,limit>>, <<times-section,times>>, and <<snapshot-section,snapshot>> parameters.

==== Parameters
[[times-section]]
===== Parameter times
The `times` parameter is a sequence of monotonic increasing instants with date-time strings (ex. "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z") that adheres to RFC3339.
It consists of a list of the date-time format string, different from <<datetime-section, `datetime`>> parameter.
The array does not allow the same element.
A sequence of monotonic increasing instants only temporal geometries that intersects the value of time is selected.
