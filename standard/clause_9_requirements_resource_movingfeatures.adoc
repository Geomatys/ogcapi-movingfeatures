=== Resource MovingFeatures
==== Overview
The `MovingFeatures` resource supports retrieving and creating operations via GET and POST HTTP methods respectively.

. A retrieve operation returns a set of features which describes the moving feature available from this API.
. A create operation post a new <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resource instance to a specific <<resource-collection-section,Collection>> (specified by {collectinoId} with this API.

The OGC API — MF `Items` query is an OGC API — Features endpoint that may be used to catalog pre-existing moving features.
If a `mFeatureID` is not specified, the query will return a list of the available moving features.
The list of moving features returned to the response can be limited using the <<bbox-section,bbox>>, <<datetime-section,datetime>>, and <<limit-section,limit>> parameters.
This behavior is specified in OGC API — Features.
All parameters for use with the `Items` query are defined by OGC API — Features.

==== Operation
===== Retrieve
The retrieve operation is defined in the `MovingFeatures` conformance class of OGC API — Features.
No modifications are needed to support <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path

Support for GET on the `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path is required by OGC API — Features.

====== Create
The create operation is defined in the `link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#create[CREATE]` conformance class of OGC API — Features.
This operation targeted <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resource.

. Issue a `POST` request on `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items` path

Support for the HTTP POST method is specified as a requirement in OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/features/REQ_operation-features-post.adoc[]

The following example adds a new feature (link:https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/19-045r3/19-045r3.html#mfeature[MovingFeature object] in <<OGC-MF-JSON, MF-JSON>>) to the specific <<resource-collection-section,Collection>>.
The feature is represented as MovingFeature object (or MovingFeatureCollection object) in <<OGC-MF-JSON, MF-JSON>>, which is a kind of extension of the link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON].
A pseudo-sequence diagram notation is used to illustrate the details of the HTTP communication between the client and the server.

==== Response
===== Retrieve
A successful response to the `MovingFeatures` GET operation is a document that contains the static data for a set of moving features.
In a typical deployment of the OGF API — MF, the `MovingFeatures` GET response will list features of all offered resource types.

====== Create
A successful response to the `MovingFeatures` POST operation is an HTTP status code.

==== Error situations
The requirements for handling unsuccessful requests are provided in the <<http-response>>.
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
