|*Abstract Test {counter:conf-id}* |*/conf/movingfeatures/tgeometries-get*
|Requirement    |
<<req_mf-tgeometry-op-get, /req/movingfeatures/tgeometries-get>> +
<<req_mf-tgeometry-response-get, /req/movingfeatures/tgeometries-get-success>>
|Test purpose   | Validate that the *TemporalGeometry* can be identified and extracted from a *MovingFeature* object using query parameters.
|Test method    |
For every *TemporalGeometry* identified in *MovingFeature*, issue an HTTP GET request to the URL `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}/tgeometry` where `{collectionId}` is the id property for a *MovingFeature Collection* described in the *MovingFeature Collections* content and `{mFeatureId}` is the id property for the *MovingFeature*

1. Validate that a document was returned with a status code `200` +
2. Validate the contents of the returned document using test <<conf_mf_tgeometries_get_success, `/conf/movingfeatures/tgeometries-get-success`>>

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests that defined in the OGC API — Common and OGC API — MF: +
- Bounding Box: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_bounding_box_tests[Bounding Box Tests] +
- Limit: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_limit_tests[Limit Tests] +
- Date-Time: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_date_time_tests[Date-Time Tests] +
- Leaf: <<conf_mf_feature_param_leaf_definition, Leaf Definition Test>> and <<conf_mf_feature_param_leaf_response, Leaf Response Test>>

Execute requests with combinations of the `"bbox"`, `"datetime"`, and `"leaf"` query parameters and verify that only features are returned that match both selection criteria.
