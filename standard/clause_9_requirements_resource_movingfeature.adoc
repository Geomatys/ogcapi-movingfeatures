=== Resource MovingFeature
==== Overview
A MovingFeature object consists of the set of static information that describes a single moving feature and the set of temporal object information, such as temporal geometry and temporal property.
An abbreviated copy of this information is returned for each `MovingFeature` in the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items` GET response.

The schema for the moving feature object presented in this clause is an extension of the `GeoJSON Feature Object` defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON].
<<moving-feature-properties-table>> defines the set of properties that may be used to describe a moving feature.

|Property           |Requirement    |Description
|_**id**_           |M |A unique identifier to the moving feature.
|_**type**_         |M |The GeoJSON feature type (i.e., one of 'Feature' or 'FeatureCollection').
|_**geometry**_     |M |Projective geometry of the moving feature.
|_**properties**_   |M |A set of property of GeoJSON.
|_**bbox**_         |O |Bounding box information for the moving feature.
|time               |O |Life span information for the moving feature.
|crs                |O |Coordinate reference system (CRS) information for the moving feature.
|trs                |O |Temporal reference system information for the moving feature.
|<<resource-tgeometries-section, temporalGeometry>> |O |A set of <<tgeometry-schema, temporal geometry>> for a moving feature.
|<<resource-tproperties-collection-section, temporalProperties>> |O |A set of <<resource-temporalProperty-section, temporal properties>> of the moving feature.

NOTE: The properties _id_, _type_, _geometry_, _properties_, and _bbox_ were inherited from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON].

==== Operation
//TODO: Why Replace operation is not supported
===== Retrieve
The retrieve operation is defined in the `Feature` conformance class of OGC API — Features.
No modifications are needed to support <<resource-movingfeature-section,MovingFeature>> resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}` path

[[movingfeature-identifier]]
The {mFeatureId} parameter is the unique identifier for a single moving feature offered by the API.
The list of valid values for `{mFeatureId}` is provided in the <<resource-mfeatures-section,`{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items`>> GET response.

Support for GET on the `{root}/collections/{collledctionID}/items/{mFeatureId}` path is required by OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/movingfeature/REQ_operation-movingfeature-get.adoc[]

===== Delete
The delete operation is defined in the `link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#delete[DELETE]` conformance class of OGC API — Features.

. Issue a `DELETE` request on `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}` path

Support for the HTTP DELETE method is required by OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/movingfeature/REQ_operation-movingfeature-delete.adoc[]

==== Response
===== Retrieve
A successful response to the `MovingFeature` GET operation is a set of metadata that describes the moving feature identified by the <<movingfeature-identifier,`{mFeatureId}`>> parameter.
This response does not include a set of temporal object information.
The temporal object information may be accessed using  <<resource-tgeometries-section, TemporalGeometryCollection>> and <<resource-tproperties-collection-section, TemporalPropertyCollection>> operations.

===== Delete
A successful response to the `Collection` DELETE operation is an HTTP status code.

==== Error situations
The requirements for handling unsuccessful requests are provided in the <<http-response>>.
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
