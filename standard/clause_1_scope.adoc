== Scope
The scope of OGC API-Moving Features-Part 1: Feature extension is to provide a uniform way to access and manage data about moving features across different applications, data providers, and data consumers.
It includes a set of RESTful web APIs that allow clients to discover, retrieve, and update information about moving features, as well as a data model for describing moving features and their trajectories.

The OGC API-Moving Features-Part 1: Feature Extension standard defines an API with two goals.
First, to provide access to representations of Moving Features that conform to the <<OGC-MF-JSON, OGC Moving Features JSON encoding standard>>.
Second, to provide functionality comparable to that of the <<OGC-MF-Access, OGC Moving Features Access standard>>.
The OGC API-Moving Features standard is an extension of the <<OGC-API-Common, OGC API-Common>> and the <<OGC-API-Features, OGC API-Features standards>>.
